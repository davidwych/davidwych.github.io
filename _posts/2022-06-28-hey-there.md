# Hi

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Lab, working on computational sturctural biology and computational chemistry.

I study protein crystallography, protein structure and disorder, and diffuse scattering, using Molecular Dynamics simulations of protein crystals.

I also have a very handsome dog.

Thanks for stopping by!
