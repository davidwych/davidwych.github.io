## SUMMARY

David C. Wych is a computational chemist and structural biologist working as a post- doctoral researcher in the Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division (CCS-3) and the Center for Non-Linear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). His research focus involves using crystalline molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to study X-ray crystallographic structural and dynamical modeling, and using QM-MM simulations to probe protein structure and dynamics beyond what is possible with classical MD.

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
