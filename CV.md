## SUMMARY

David C. Wych is a computational chemist and structural biologist working as a postdoctoral research associate in the Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division (CCS-3) and the Center for Non-Linear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). 

His research focus involves using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of protein crystal systems to better understand and improve the modeling of protein/solvent structure and disorder in X-ray crystallography (specifically, the "diffuse scattering"), developing High-performance Computing methods for crystallographic modeling and refinement, and using QM-MD simulations to probe protein structure and dynamics beyond what is possible with classical MD.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Post-doctoral Researcher -- LANL -- Computer, Computational and Statistical Sciences Division (CCS-3) and the Center for Non-linear Studies (CNLS) -- 2021-present
- Created new advanced methods for X-ray crystallographic (XRC) modeling & refinement using structure factors calculated from molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of protein crystals (in review; preprint: [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.04.486986v1)).
- [Developed software](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/785) in C++ and Python for the modeling of serial femtosecond XRC data on next-generation supercomputers as part of the [DOE Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org), allowing for fast refinement of parameters in the modeling of diffuse scattering.
- Developed software in FORTRAN for quantum mechanical simulations of large protein-solvent systems (thousands of atoms) using cutting-edge fast quantum molecular dynamics (QM-MD) algorithms (SCC-DFTB in [LATTE](https://github.com/lanl/LATTE) & NAMD).

### Graduate Student Researcher -- UCI -- Pharmaceutical Sciences -- 2016-2021

- [Published work](https://aca.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5132692) in *Structural Dynamics* which used MD simulations to characterize correlated disorder in protein crystals, to predict the diffuse scattering in XRC, and to provide context to a long-standing debate about the main source of diffuse scattering (selected as a [SciLight](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/10.0000388) by the American Institute of Physics [AIP])
- Investigated the prediction of diffuse scattering using Markov State Models (MSMs)
- Developed methods for improving structural modeling and refinement in XRC with structure factors calculated from MD simulations of protein crystals.

### Virtual Summer Intern -- LANL -- CNLS -- Summer 2020

- Prepared, ran, and analyzed MD simulations of protein crystals, studying the effect of restraint strength on the prediction of avg. structure and harmonic disorder (B-factors). 

### Graduate Student Assistant -- LANL -- CCS-3 -- Winter-Fall 2019

- Prepared, ran, and analyzed MD simulations, characterizing the nature of correlated disorder in protein crystals, and predicting diffuse scattering in XRC.
