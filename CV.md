# CV

## SUMMARY

David C. Wych is a computational chemist and structural biologist working as a post- doctoral researcher in the Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division (CCS-3) and the Center for Non-Linear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). His research focus involves using crystalline molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to study X-ray crystallographic structural and dynamical modeling, and using QM-MM simulations to probe protein structure and dynamics beyond what is possible with classical MD.

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Research areas**: crystalline molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations for the study of protein X-ray crystallographic modeling and refinement, structural heterogeneity, and diffuse scattering; software development for QM-MM simulation of whole proteins; high performance computing (HPC) methods for the processing and modeling of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallographic data from X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs).

### GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCHER — UCI — 2016-2021

### CNLS VIRTUAL SUMMER INTERN — LANL — SUMMER 2020

### GRADUATE STUDENT ASSISTANT — LANL — WINTER-FALL 2019

### APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING SUMMER FELLOW — LANL — SUMMER 2018
