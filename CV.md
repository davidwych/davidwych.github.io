## SUMMARY

David C. Wych is a computational chemist and structural biologist working as a post- doctoral researcher in the Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division (CCS-3) and the Center for Non-Linear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). 

His research focus involves using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of protein crystal systems to better understand and improve the modeling of protein/solvent structure and disorder in X-ray crystallography, developing High-performance Computing methods for crystallographic modelling and refinement, and using QM-MM simulations to probe protein structure and dynamics beyond what is possible with classical MD.
